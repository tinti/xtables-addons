====


v1.41 (2012-01-04)
==================
Changes:
- Deactivate build of ipset-genl by default.
  I think the original ipset package can now take over, given there are
  a handful of kernels (2.6.39 onwards) that do not need patching.
Enhancements:
- Support for Linux 3.2


v1.40 (2011-11-30)
==================
Fixes:
- build: the code actually requires at least iptables 1.4.5 (would yield a
  compile error otherwise), make sure configure checks for it; update INSTALL
- xt_ECHO: fix kernel warning about RTAX_HOPLIMIT being used
- xt_ipv4options: fix an infinite loop
Changes:
- xt_ECHO: now calculates UDP checksum
- Linux kernel versions below 2.6.32 are no longer officially
  supported, and will not be part of compilation testing.
- update to ipset 6.10
Enhancements:
- xt_ECHO: IPv6 support


v1.39 (2011-09-21)
==================
Fixes:
- libxt_ACCOUNT: fix compilation after missing libxtables_CFLAGS
- build: fix compilation after missing libxtables_CFLAGS in submodules

Changes:
- Remove unsupported ipset 4.x from the Xtables-addons distribution
- ipset: move ipset_errcode from src to library to avoid undefined reference
- update to ipset 6.9.1

- xt_TARPIT: honeypot and reset modes
- update to ipset 6.7
- support for Linux 3.0


v1.35 (2011-04-11)
==================
Enhancements:
- update to ipset 6.3
  * allow "new" as a commad alias to "create"
  * resolving IP addresses did not work at listing/saving sets, fixed
  * check ICMP and ICMPv6 with the set match and target in the testsuite

- xt_pknock: avoid inversion of rule lookup that led to warnings
- xt_DNETMAP: add missing module alias
- xt_DNETMAP: support for kernels below 2.6.34
Changes:
- Linux kernel versions below 2.6.29 are no longer officially
  supported, and will not be part of compilation testing.


v1.33 (2011-02-02)
==================
Fixes:
- build: restore functionality of `configure --without-kbuild`
- build: fix objdir builds for ipset-5 (xt-a specific)

==================
Fixes:
- Update to ipset 4.5
  * the iptreemap type used wrong gfp flags when deleting entries
- Include ipset 5.2 with genetlink patch (beta)
  * no kernel patch needed, but requires Linux >= 2.6.35
    and thus needs to be manually enabled in mconfig


v1.31 (2010-11-05)
==================
Fixes:
- build: improve detection of kernel version and error handling
Changes:
- build: automatically derive Xtables module directory, thus
  --with-xtlibdir is no longer needed for ./configure in most cases
  (If I still see a distro using it, I will scold you for not
  reading this changelog.)
Enhancements:
- LOGMARK: print remaining lifetime of cts
- xt_iface: allow matching against incoming/outgoing interface
- libxt_gradm: match packets based on status of grsecurity RBAC
  (userspace part only - xt_gradm is in the grsec patch)


v1.30 (2010-010-02)
===================
Fixes:
- update to ipset 4.4
  * ipport{,ip,net}hash did not work with mixed "src" and "dst"
    destination parameters
Changes:
- deactivate building xt_TEE and xt_CHECKSUM by default, as these have been
  merged upstream in Linux 2.6.35 and 2.6.36, respectively.
  Distros still wishing to build this need to enable it in their build
  script, e.g. perl -i -pe 's{^build_TEE=.*}{build_TEE=m}' mconfig;
